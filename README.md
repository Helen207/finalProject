# How to run this project locally on your machine

Firstable you need to have installed python on you machine:

## Local install
* [Download python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - recommended version is 3.9 (but it should work with last version)
* [Chrome driver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/getting_started/install_drivers/) - recommended version 101.0.4951.64

* if you have homebrew for chrome driver you can use - this is easy peasy
    ```
    brew install cask chromedriver
    ```

## Project install
Once you have the project open in your code editor, go to the terminal and verify that you are located in the particular project
When you run ls you should see all folders and files from finalProject folder

* create my venv  - this step is optional
    ```
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

* install robotframework
    ```
    pip3 install robotframework
    ```
* install seleniumlibrary
    ```
    pip3 install robotframework-seleniumlibrary
    ```
* check what you already have
    ```
    pip3 freeze
    ```
### OR you can install requirements file running

    pip3  install -r requirements.txt

## Project Settings - this is optional BUT nice to have 
* Right click on the project folder in the code editor
* Copy full path 
* Go to the Project Settings -for mac click on the project folder and pres âŒ˜ , for Win File -> Settings
* Click on Language & Frameworks -> Robot Framework (Project)
* Paste full path into Language Server Python 

path should looks like
    ```
    /Users/yourusername/PycharmProjects/finalProject/venv/bin/python
    ```
## Run test
Go to you terminal:
* activate test environment
    ```
